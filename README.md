Customer Review Sentiment Analyzer â€“ ML Web App using Python and Gradio :
This project is a web-based machine learning application built using Python and the Gradio library. It performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews using a Logistic Regression model. Users can enter any review and get instant feedback on whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative â€” all via an intuitive web interface.

Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify text sentiment. It's ideal for students, businesses, or developers who want to understand how customer feedback can be automatically analyzed and categorized using machine learning.

Technologies and Libraries Used
Python â€“ Programming language for logic and modeling.

Pandas â€“ For reading and handling datasets.

Scikit-learn (sklearn) â€“ For training the sentiment classifier and processing text data.

TfidfVectorizer â€“ For converting text into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.

Logistic Regression â€“ A powerful linear classification model.

Gradio â€“ For building the web-based user interface.

Features of the Application
ðŸ”¹ Preloaded Dataset
The app loads a dataset (customer_reviews.csv) that contains customer reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.

ðŸ”¹ Text Preprocessing
The review texts are transformed into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer, which helps the model understand and weigh the importance of words in context.

ðŸ”¹ Model Training
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A Logistic Regression classifier is trained to predict sentiment labels based on the TF-IDF vectors.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Sentiment Prediction
Users can type a customer review into the textbox, click the Analyze Sentiment button, and get an instant sentiment prediction (e.g., "Positive", "Neutral", or "Negative").

ðŸ”¹ Web-Based UI with Gradio
The interface is created using Gradio with a soft theme and a clean, responsive layout:

Markdown header for context

Textbox for input

Button for interaction

Output textbox for results

Advantages and Use Cases
Simple and fast web interface â€” no programming required.

Helps businesses or teams quickly assess customer mood from reviews.

Ideal for learning NLP concepts like TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.


Can be expanded to support more categories or advanced models (e.g., deep learning).

Useful for educational demos, product feedback analysis, or social media sentiment monitoring.

Conclusion : 
The Customer Review Sentiment Analyzer is a lightweight and effective ML application that blends natural language processing with a user-friendly web interface. With just a few lines of input, users can gain insights into customer sentiment, making it a valuable tool for both educational and practical use.
